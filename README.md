# SukkomiðŸŒ¸
An electron-based md editor based on Vite, Electron, React, Remark and CodeMirror.
## How to set up (first time)
cd to extracted folder
run `npm i`
## How to watch/deploy
`npm run watch` (Uses Vite)
## How to build
`npm run compile --openssl_fips=X` (on Windows you will need node-gyp with VSBuildTools 2019, Python 2.7)

(also to get vibrancy to work on windows I needed to use electron-acrylic-window module which misbehaves if not compiled with --openssl_fips=X)

Built files will be located under the "dist" folder.

## What needs to be worked on
* [ ] File Saving

* [ ] Custom syntax theme for code blocks
